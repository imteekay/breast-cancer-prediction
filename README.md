# Breast Cancer Prediction

✨ [Notebook](breast_cancer_diagnostic.ipynb): Predicting whether breast cancer tumors are malignant or benign.

- `Import & Data`: importing libraries, loading data, and transforming it into a dataframe
- `Data Analysis & Exploration`: exploring features, data types, missing values, removing unnecessary 'features', and analyzing data distribution and variable correlation
- `Outlier Analysis`: visually potential outliers, using z-score to spot those outliers, and building a dataframe without them
- `Data Preprocessing`: separate the target from the predictors, label encode the target, and scale the data (both to the original dataframe and the one w/o outliers)
- `Helper Functions`: build functions to help with performing the predictions (test-training split and w/ PCA) and to plot graphs about the models' metrics
- `Prediction Models`: perform predictions with different models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- `Model Analysis & Comparison`: compare all models' metrics
